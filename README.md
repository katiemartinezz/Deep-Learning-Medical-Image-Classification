# Deep-Learning-Medical-Image-Classification

Image classification, though not a new concept of machine learning has gained significant attention due to its application in various domains, including healthcare. The primary objective of this project was to develop a deep-learning model capable of accurately classifying medical images belonging to 6 classes. (For this project, we utilized the Medical MNIST dataset, which was made available on Kaggle)

However, beyond the classification task, we focused on understanding the intricate process of developing a deep-learning model. From addressing concerns with data, determining hyperparameters, and assessing generalization to evaluating the model we were able to fulfill all our goals. 

We created two deep-learning models. The first model (Model 1) follows an AlexNet-like structure, while the second model (Model 2) explores a more experimental design with varying depth and hyperparameters. Both models follow a similar setup, but the model itself is different.
